This project is a proof of concept microservice written in Kotlin with FastAPI.
It was written to test if FastAPI is a good fit for writing microservices in a
larger project.

The microservice demonstrates:

- API endpoints with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- Validation with [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)
- Database migration with [DBMate](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate)
- DB access with [SqlAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- Testing with pytest

**Versions**
  
- Python version: 3.8
- FastAPI version: 0.70.0
- SqlAlchemy version: 1.4.26
